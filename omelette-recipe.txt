Basic omelette:

Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper. Beat well with a fork.

Put a small frying pan on a low heat and let it get hot. Add a small knob of butter. 
When the butter has melted and is bubbling, add your eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly. 
When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the cheese, 
if using (I sometimes grate mine directly on to the omelette).

Using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in half. 
When it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omelette on to a plate.

Tomato and basil omelette: 
2 or 3 sprigs of fresh basil 
a handful of cherry tomatoes 

Pick the leaves off the basil and roughly tear them. 
Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and add to a hot frying pan with a small knob of butter, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. 
Fry and toss around for about 1 minute, then turn the heat down to medium and sprinkle over the basil leaves. 
Add your eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly. Continue as for the basic omelette.
